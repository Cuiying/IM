For Web Service:
	1. Web Service needs to create an asymmetric-encryption and send keys to clients.
	      We will use Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange.
	   	  http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~dmarino/ucf/cis3362/progs/DiffieHellmanBigInt.java
	2. We will use SHA-512 to hash the password and the hash code will be stored in the web
		  service rather than local machine.
	3. The message package will contain source (username/accountNumber) & message for current 
		  plan
	4. We will use map to pre-load all user info, when we want to add a new user info, we add
		  it to map and call DefaultXMLService, pass the map to re-create the whole xml file
